                    Welcome to our Election Manifesto Platform, a modern web application designed to empower students in their decision-making process during student elections. This platform allows candidates running for various positions to upload their manifestos, share their plans, and engage with the student body.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    Candidates can create profiles, submit detailed manifestos, and even share videos to communicate their vision directly to the voters. The platform gives students a chance to evaluate each candidateâ€™s proposals based on the issues that matter most to them. Students can browse through different candidates, view their manifestos, and cast votes based on their preferences.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    With a transparent voting system and real-time results, this platform helps students make informed choices while ensuring fairness and accessibility in the election process. Whether you're a candidate looking to make your mark or a student deciding on the best candidate, our platform provides the tools to foster a better and more democratic election environment.
